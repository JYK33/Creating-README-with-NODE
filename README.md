# John Kang, Module 9; Gererating a README



## Description
The purpose of this assignment was to use Node and its dependencies to create a professional readme file. This module will use Inquirer to prompt the user with questions that will be used to create the README file. 
The README file will be able to generate a file name, title, licenses, table of contents, description, installation, usage, contribution, tests, and personal information.
